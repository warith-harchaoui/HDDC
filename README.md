# HDDC
 High-Dimensional Data Clustering (HDDC) is a model-based clustering method specifically designed for high-dimensional datasets. It extends the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) by leveraging covariance constraints and subspace dimensionality reduction to efficiently cluster data in high-dimensional spaces
